# 🧪 Screen Share Testing Guide

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Issue
Screen share was broadcasting from host but **not displaying on participant side**.

### Root Cause
The renegotiation offer didn't include a flag to tell participants "this is a screen share, not a camera."

### Solution
Added `isScreenShare` flag and `screenShareStreamId` to the WebRTC offer payload.

## 🧪 How to Test

### Test 1: Basic Screen Share (2 Browsers)

**Setup:**
1. Open meeting in **Browser A** (Chrome) as Host
2. Open same meeting in **Browser B** (Firefox) as Participant

**Steps:**
1. **Host (Browser A):**
   - Click "Share Screen" button
   - Select window/screen to share
   - Click "Share"

2. **Expected on Host:**
   ```
   ✅ Screen share displayed for: You
   ✅ Screen track added to peer: [participant-id]
   📺 Broadcasting screen to 1 participants
   🔄 Renegotiation offer sent to [participant-id] for screen share (Stream ID: xxx)
   ```

3. **Expected on Participant (Browser B):**
   ```
   📺 Marked stream [stream-id] as screen share from [host-id]
   Received remote track from: [host-id] video
   📺 Received screen share from: [host-id] Stream ID: xxx
   ✅ Screen share displayed for: [Host Name]
   ```

4. **Visual Check:**
   - ✅ Participant sees host's screen content (NOT placeholder)
   - ✅ Screen share in large container at top
   - ✅ Label shows host's name
   - ✅ Host's camera video in small tile below

---

### Test 2: Multiple Participants

**Setup:**
1. Browser A (Host)
2. Browser B (Participant 1)
3. Browser C (Participant 2)

**Steps:**
1. Host shares screen
2. **Check Browser B:** See screen share ✅
3. **Check Browser C:** See screen share ✅
4. Host stops screen share
5. **Check Browser B:** Screen share removed ✅
6. **Check Browser C:** Screen share removed ✅

---

### Test 3: Late Joiner

**Setup:**
1. Browser A (Host) - Already sharing screen
2. Browser B (New Participant) - Joins after screen share started

**Steps:**
1. Host starts screen share
2. Wait 5 seconds
3. Participant joins meeting
4. **Expected:** Participant sees screen share immediately ✅

**Note:** This might not work yet - late joiners need special handling.

---

### Test 4: Screen Share Toggle

**Steps:**
1. Host shares screen
2. Participant sees it ✅
3. Host stops screen share
4. Participant's screen share disappears ✅
5. Host shares screen again
6. Participant sees it again ✅

## 🔍 Console Logs to Check

### On Host Side (When Starting Screen Share):
```javascript
✅ Screen share displayed for: You
✅ Screen track added to peer: ee698655-28ca-4d71-89fa-d0887b9a5e53 with stream ID: 5ccff534-2cda-4be5-9fc0-b4d194aedcdb
📺 Broadcasting screen to 26 participants with stream ID: 5ccff534-2cda-4be5-9fc0-b4d194aedcdb

## ❌ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Participant doesn't see screen share

**Check 1: Is the offer being sent?**
```javascript
// On host console, look for:
🔄 Renegotiation offer sent to [peer-id] for screen share
```
- ❌ Not found → Screen share broadcast failed
- ✅ Found → Offer sent successfully

**Check 2: Is participant receiving the offer?**
```javascript
// On participant console, look for:
Received offer from: [host-id]
📺 Marked stream [id] as screen share
```
- ❌ Not found → Signaling channel issue
- ✅ Found → Offer received

**Check 3: Is the track being received?**
```javascript
// On participant console, look for:
Received remote track from: [host-id] video
```
- ❌ Not found → WebRTC connection issue
- ✅ Found → Track received

**Check 4: Is it being detected as screen share?**
```javascript
// On participant console, look for:
📺 Received screen share from: [host-id]
```
- ❌ Not found → Detection logic failed
- ✅ Found → Detected correctly

**Check 5: Is it being displayed?**
```javascript
// On participant console, look for:
✅ Screen share displayed for: [Host Name]
```
- ❌ Not found → Display function failed
- ✅ Found → Should be visible

---

### Issue: Screen share shows placeholder

This means the detection logic failed. Check:

1. **Stream ID mismatch:**
   - Compare stream ID in offer vs ontrack event
   - Should be the same

2. **screenShareStreamIds Set:**
   ```javascript
   // In participant console:
   console.log(window.screenShareStreamIds);
   // Should contain the screen share stream ID
   ```

3. **Track label:**
   ```javascript
   // Check if track label indicates screen:
   event.track.label.toLowerCase().includes('screen')
   ```

---

### Issue: Multiple screen shares conflict

Currently, only one screen share at a time is supported. If multiple people share:
- Last one wins
- Previous screen share gets replaced

**Future Enhancement:** Support multiple simultaneous screen shares.

---

## 📊 Success Criteria

### ✅ All These Should Work:

1. **Host can start screen share**
   - Button works
   - Browser prompts for screen selection
   - Local preview shows screen

2. **Participants see screen share**
   - Actual screen content visible (not placeholder)
   - Labeled with host's name
   - Displayed in large container

3. **Host can stop screen share**
   - Button toggles back
   - Screen share removed from all participants
   - Camera video remains

4. **Multiple participants**
   - All participants see same screen share
   - Works with 2+ participants

5. **Connection recovery**
   - If participant disconnects and reconnects
   - Screen share reappears automatically

---

## 🎯 Known Limitations

### 1. Late Joiners
**Issue:** Participants who join after screen share started might not see it.

**Workaround:** Host can stop and restart screen share.

**Future Fix:** Store screen share state and send to new joiners.

### 2. Multiple Simultaneous Shares
**Issue:** Only one person can share screen at a time.

**Workaround:** Coordinate who shares.

**Future Fix:** Support multiple screen shares with tabs/grid.

### 3. Screen Share Quality
**Issue:** Quality depends on network bandwidth.

**Workaround:** Share specific window instead of entire screen.

**Future Fix:** Add quality settings (720p, 1080p, etc.).

### 4. Audio Sharing
**Issue:** System audio might not be captured.

**Workaround:** Use "Share tab" and check "Share audio".

**Future Fix:** Always request audio in getDisplayMedia.

## 🚀 Next Steps

### If Screen Share Works:
1. ✅ Test with multiple participants
2. ✅ Test screen share toggle
3. ✅ Test different screen sources (window, tab, screen)
4. ✅ Deploy to production

### If Screen Share Doesn't Work:
1. Check console logs (both host and participant)
2. Verify WebRTC connections are established
3. Check network/firewall settings
4. Try different browsers
5. Report issue with console logs
